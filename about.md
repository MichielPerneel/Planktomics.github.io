Nice to meet you, fellow marine enthusiast. My name is Michiel and I am a evolutionary biologist interested in the ocean and everything genetics. My own research focuses on the metatranscriptome of the North Sea marine eukaryotic plankton community, in order to get a better understanding of how climate change might affect these beautiful organisms. For the moment I am affiliated to the Flanders Marine Institute and Ghent University. This blog was started hoping to document my scientific interests and share my enthusiasm on these topics.
